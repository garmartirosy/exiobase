# Comprehensive trade push: every region, direct to Azure, local folders for all 49 by default

## Known issue: 2024's `trade_factor` coverage is far sparser than other years

`industrydb_2024`'s `trade_factor` table has only ~403K rows covering ~20% of `trade` rows
(1 factor per covered row), vs. `industrydb_2020`'s ~7.6M rows covering ~100% of `trade` rows
(~4 factors/row on average). Investigated 2026-09-21; root cause is the **upstream Exiobase
source file for 2024**, not a bug in `trade_extraction.py`'s `compute_trade_factor` or the
comprehensive push:

- The downloaded `exiobase_data/IOT_2024_pxp.zip` (fetched via `exiobase_download.py`'s direct
  Zenodo fallback, since `pymrio.download_exiobase3` doesn't resolve current Zenodo URLs) is
  **missing the `employment/`, `energy/`, and `water/` extension folders entirely** — it only has
  `factor_inputs/`, `air_emissions/`, `material/`, `nutrients/`, `land/`. 2020's zip has all 8.
  `compute_trade_factor`'s `hasattr(exio_model, ext_name)` check correctly skips missing
  extensions, so this alone would explain a coverage drop, but not the full picture.
- Worse: of the extensions that *are* present, `air_emissions.M` and `land.M` (the
  `calc_all()`-computed characterized-multiplier matrices `compute_trade_factor` actually reads)
  come out **entirely zero** for 2024 — confirmed directly via `pymrio.parse_exiobase3(...).calc_all()`
  — even though their raw `F`/`S` coefficient matrices have real, substantial nonzero data
  (1.2M+ nonzero cells). Only `material.M` computes real values for 2024. This wasn't traced
  further into pymrio's `M = S @ L` computation internals; it looks like a data-quality issue in
  the specific 2024 file Zenodo served (Exiobase's real historical releases only officially cover
  through ~2022, so "2024" is likely a preliminary/nowcast release with incomplete or
  malformed extension normalization), not something fixable in this repo's code.
- Practical implication: **treat any comprehensive push for a very recent year (2023/2024) as
  needing this same coverage check** (`count(DISTINCT region1)` and a `trade`/`trade_factor` row
  ratio, per-region, before trusting the push) — don't assume parity with established years like
  2018-2022 just because the run completes without errors.

## Known gap: comprehensive push never truncates existing tables first

Neither `trade_comprehensive.py` nor `industrydb.py`'s push functions truncate `trade`/
`trade_factor`/`interstate`/`interstate_factor` before pushing — they only `INSERT ... ON
CONFLICT`. Re-running comprehensive mode for a year that already has data from the **old**
per-country block `trade_id` scheme (e.g. 2019, 2021, 2023 as originally pushed) will leave the
old-scheme rows in place alongside the new full-Exiobase-order rows, with no guarantee their
`trade_id` ranges don't collide or their data doesn't just duplicate/conflict. Before re-running
comprehensive mode against a year with pre-existing data from a different scheme, truncate that
year's tables first with the team repo's standalone tool (not wired into any API):
```
cd team && cargo run --bin truncate_year_tables -- <year>
```

Plan for a new `comprehensive` processing mode that extracts trade flows for **every** Exiobase
region in one pass (not a curated 14-country list) and writes them straight to Azure Postgres. By
default the target is a dedicated per-year database (`industrydb_{year}`, created if missing) — the
same convention already used for `industrydb_2019`/`industrydb_2021`/`industrydb_2023` — rather
than the shared, multi-year `industrydb`; `COMPREHENSIVE.target: industrydb` switches to that
shared database instead, adding `year` as a real column (see "Database write path" below for why
the per-year database is the default). By default it also writes a local `year/{year}/{country}/`
folder for **all 49 regions** (not just the curated 14) — see `COMPREHENSIVE.folders` below for
scoping that down to just the 14 when the full 49's disk/git footprint isn't wanted. Initial
target year: **2018**.

This is additive: `default`/`all` keep working exactly as they do now (curated country list,
local CSVs, `POST /api/db/insert-trade-data`, per-country `trade_id` blocks). `comprehensive` is a
third, independent code path that happens to share almost all of its extraction and database
logic with the existing one — see "Reuse checklist" at the end.

A comprehensive run also becomes the source of local `.csv` folders going forward, exported from
whichever Azure database the run targeted right after the push commits (see "Local `.csv` output
for country folders" below) — so the `trade_id` values a website page reads out of
`year/{year}/{country}/{flow}/trade.csv` are, by construction, the exact same values a query
against that database returns for that row, not a second, independently-computed numbering.

## Implementation status

Everything in this plan is now built:

- `config.yaml` — `comprehensive` `COUNTRY.list` value + `COMPREHENSIVE.folders` (default `all`) +
  `COMPREHENSIVE.target` (default `year_db`, or `industrydb` for the shared database);
  `config_loader.py` — `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS`/`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET` overrides +
  `get_comprehensive_folders_scope()`/`get_comprehensive_target()`.
- `trade_extraction.py` — the shared module: `EXIOBASE_REGIONS` (49-region canonical order,
  verified against `unit.txt`), `extract_region_chunk` (slice-before-stack, and — since a later
  revision — Exiobase's own row order within one region's rows too, not alphabetical), `aggregate_factors`/
  `build_factor_mapping`/`compute_trade_factor` (pulled out of `trade.py`, which now delegates to
  them — confirmed unchanged single-country behavior via a live extraction run against the
  already-downloaded 2021 data), and `ensure_industry_mapping`/`ensure_sector_tables`/
  `ensure_factors_export`.
- `industrydb.py` — direct `psycopg2` connection to either `industrydb_{year}` (default) or the
  shared `industrydb`, picked per call via a `target` argument; `push_trade_rows`/
  `push_trade_factor_rows` (COPY-to-staging-then-`INSERT...ON CONFLICT`, with or without a `year`
  column depending on `target`), `pull_trade_rows`/`pull_trade_factor_rows`/`pull_factor_reference`
  (the Azure-export side of "Local `.csv` output"), and `push_reference_tables` (calls the new Rust
  endpoint, passing `year`/`target` through).
- `trade_comprehensive.py` — the region-loop driver: prints a terminal confirmation banner naming
  the target database/host and requires a literal `y` before pushing anything (bypassed
  non-interactively via `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_CONFIRM=yes`, for cron/automation); streams all 49
  regions to whichever database `COMPREHENSIVE.target` resolved to, slices exports/domestic locally
  per in-scope region during the loop, pulls imports from that same database after the loop, writes
  the non-default regions' own `runnote.md` and the default-14's `.comprehensive_timing.json`
  sidecar.
- `export_country_csvs.py` — the ad-hoc "add a folder later" exporter (all three flow types,
  straight from whichever database that year was loaded into).
- `team/src/merge_years.rs` — `POST /api/db/comprehensive/push-reference-tables`, branching on a
  `target` field: default creates/targets `industrydb_{year}` (`connect_to_exiobase_year`/
  `init_industry_tables_in_pool`, plain `upsert_factor_rows` — no remap, a from-scratch database has
  nothing to remap against) or, with `target: "industrydb"`, the shared database (`connect_to_
  industrydb`/`ensure_merge_infra`/`upsert_factor_rows_merged`, `factor_id_map` in the response).
  Either way: region seed (all 49 codes, now with `name` too — see "`region` table" below) + the
  other three reference-table upserts. Routed in `main.rs`. Builds clean (`cargo build`, no new
  warnings).
- `main.py` — `get_country_list_value()`, `run_comprehensive_processing()`, `run_country_processing`
  now takes an optional trimmed `scripts` list (skips `trade.py` for the post-comprehensive
  default-14 pass) and `extra_runnote_lines`, `create_runnote()` takes `extra_lines`.
- `team/admin/sql/panel` — the "Send Trade Data to Azure" panel (the `default`/`all` per-country
  path's own UI) checks `industrydb_{year}`'s on-disk size before showing its countries/flow-types
  checkboxes, hiding them with an explanatory message once a year is already comprehensive (size
  cutoff, not region/country coverage — `region` gets seeded to all 49 on any database's init
  regardless of how much trade data is actually loaded, so it isn't a valid signal).

**Verified so far:** the full region-loop → `trade_id` offsetting → local-folder-derivation →
Azure-imports-pull pipeline was run end-to-end against real, already-downloaded 2021 Exiobase data
with `industrydb` mocked out (a real Postgres round trip needs live `EXIOBASE_*` credentials this
environment doesn't have) — confirmed globally sequential `trade_id`s with zero gaps across
regions, correct `default`-14-vs-other-35 folder/runnote/sidecar branching under both
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` settings, and `export_country_csvs.py`'s three-flow-type export shape. Also
verified directly against `industrydb_2019`/`2021`/`2023` (read-only queries): none of them have all
49 regions loaded (2019/2021 have just `US`; 2023 has its 14 `default`-list countries), and their
sizes (416–779MB) informed the admin panel's size cutoff above, extrapolated pending a real
49-region push to measure directly.

**Not yet done:** an actual live comprehensive run (needs `EXIOBASE_PROVISION_*` credentials, now
added to `docker/.env`, so `industrydb_2018` can actually be created — and writes real production
rows either way, a deliberate, confirmable step behind `trade_comprehensive.py`'s own terminal
prompt, not something to run silently) and downloading the 2018 Exiobase file itself (not present
in `exiobase_data/` yet). See "Rollout: 2018" below for that sequence.

## Why today's approach doesn't scale to "every region"

`trade.py` filters Exiobase's global inter-industry matrix (`Z`) down to one country's rows before
writing `trade.csv`, then that file is committed to the `trade-data` repo, fetched back over
`raw.githubusercontent.com` by `team`'s Rust backend (`fetch_github_csv`), and inserted with a
per-country `trade_id` block (`country_block_index`, see `PLAN-merge.md` in `team`). That
mechanism — not the *existence* of local files, which comprehensive still produces by default —
is the part that doesn't scale to 49 regions:

- **The GitHub round-trip is unnecessary.** Committing a file just so a server can immediately
  fetch it back over HTTP only makes sense when the round-trip is the only way to get data into
  Postgres. It isn't here (see "Database write path" below): pushing straight to Postgres and
  *separately* writing the local file from the same in-memory/already-committed data skips two
  network hops for the actual database load, whether or not a local folder also gets written.
- **Per-country `trade_id` blocks aren't needed.** They exist so that adding country #15 to an
  *already-loaded* database can't collide with country #1's ids. Comprehensive builds the entire
  year in one shot, so a plain 1-based sequential id (per Exiobase's own row order, across all 49
  regions) can't collide with itself, whether or not every region actually gets pushed — see
  "Trade ID scheme" below for why it also can't collide with anything already in `industrydb`.
  With `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` (added for the 2024 run — see below), the excluded
  regions' ids are simply never inserted, leaving gaps rather than shifting later regions' ids; a
  later `folders: all` run for the same year would assign those exact same ids to the
  now-newly-included regions.

Local file *volume* is a separate, genuine tradeoff: 49 regions' worth of `trade.csv`/
`trade_factor.csv` is real disk/git footprint that the curated 14-country list never had to carry.
2018's run accepted that footprint in full (`COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all`) because generating it
cost nothing extra in *compute* at the time — the region-chunk that would produce a local file was
already sitting in memory for all 49 regions regardless of how many folders got written (see
"Extraction" below). Starting with the 2024 run, `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` no longer only
skips the local file for an excluded region — it also skips computing `trade_factor` and pushing
that region to Azure at all (see the region loop in `trade_comprehensive.py`), since a comprehensive
run using only the 14 default countries has no use for the other 35 regions' data in either form.

## `config.yaml`: add `comprehensive` as a third `COUNTRY.list` option, plus a scope knob

Today's `NOTES` section documents two `COUNTRY.list` values that `resolve_country_list()` in
`main.py` special-cases: `default` (14 countries) and `all` (whatever country folders already
exist on disk, i.e. the short curated list currently in `trade-data/year/{year}/`). Add a third,
plus a new `COMPREHENSIVE.folders` setting controlling how many of the 49 regions get pushed to
Azure *and* get a local folder (default: all 49 — see the note above on the 2024 change):

```yaml
NOTES:
  1: COUNTRY.list "default" = run only incomplete ones within AU, BR, CA,
    CN, DE, FR, GB, IN, IT, JP, KR, RU, WM, US
  2: COUNTRY.list "all" = run all (could take hours)
  3: COUNTRY.list "comprehensive" = process every Exiobase region (all 49 —
    see PLAN-comprehensive.md) in one extraction for one year. No
    per-country trade_id blocks. Set TRADEFLOW to anything; comprehensive
    ignores it (imports/exports/domestic all come out of one extraction —
    see PLAN-comprehensive.md). Pushes to Azure and writes a local
    year/[year]/[country]/ folder for every one of the 49 regions by
    default — set COMPREHENSIVE.folders to "default" to limit BOTH the
    Azure push and local .csv output to just the 14 default-list countries
    (changed for the 2024 run; 2018 used "all"). trade_id still counts
    every one of the 49 regions in Exiobase's own row order regardless, so
    a region outside the scope just leaves a gap in the numbering, rather
    than shifting later regions' ids — see "Trade ID scheme" below.
  4: COMPREHENSIVE.target picks the Azure database — "year_db" (default) —
    a dedicated industrydb_[year] database, created if missing, with no
    year column needed since trade_id is globally sequential within that
    database. Set to "industrydb" to instead push to the shared,
    multi-year database, with year as a real column on trade/trade_factor
    and trade_id unique only per year (see PLAN-comprehensive.md's
    "Database write path"). EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET overrides this
    setting the same way EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS overrides
    COMPREHENSIVE.folders.
COMPREHENSIVE:
  folders: all   # "all" (default, all 49 regions pushed to Azure + get a local folder) | "default" (only the 14 default-list countries, either way)
  target: year_db   # "year_db" (default, dedicated industrydb_[year]) | "industrydb" (shared multi-year database)
```

`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS`/`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET` override `COMPREHENSIVE.folders`/
`COMPREHENSIVE.target` the same way `EXIOBASE_TRADEFLOW`/`EXIOBASE_YEAR`/`EXIOBASE_COUNTRY_LIST`
already override their config.yaml counterparts in `config_loader.load_config()` — same pattern,
one more `if os.environ.get(...)` block each, no change to the override mechanism itself.
`EXIOBASE_YEAR`/`EXIOBASE_COUNTRY_LIST`/`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET`/`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS`
each also accept a short bare-name alias — `YEAR`/`COUNTRY_LIST`/`DB_TARGET`/`SCOPE` — for a shorter
comprehensive-mode command line (`YEAR=2024 COUNTRY_LIST=comprehensive DB_TARGET=industrydb
SCOPE=default python main.py`); the `EXIOBASE_`-prefixed name wins if both are set, so the short
form is a convenience, not a second source of truth. `SCOPE`, not `FOLDERS`, since
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` now also limits the Azure push, not just local `.csv` output.

`DB_TARGET` (optional — omitting it defaults every year to `year_db`) also accepts a
comma-separated list when `YEAR` is itself a comma-separated multi-year list: either one value
applied to every year, or exactly one target per year, positionally matched in the same order.
Either form's entries may be an explicit per-year database name (`industrydb_2018`) instead of the
bare `year_db` keyword — `config_loader.resolve_comprehensive_targets(years, target_value)` checks
that name's year against its corresponding `YEAR` entry, called once in `main.py` before the
per-year processing loop starts (not per year, and not inside `trade_comprehensive.py`'s
subprocess), and raises before anything runs if they don't align, or if `DB_TARGET`'s list length
doesn't match `YEAR`'s. This is specifically to catch `YEAR=2019 DB_TARGET=industrydb_2018` (or the
comma-separated equivalent for one position in a multi-year run) — a typo that would otherwise
silently push one year's data into another year's database rather than failing up front. Once
validated, `main.py` re-exports each year's already-resolved single target as
`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET` right alongside its existing per-year `EXIOBASE_YEAR` re-export, so
`trade_comprehensive.py`'s own `get_comprehensive_target()` (used inside the subprocess) only ever
sees one plain `year_db`/`industrydb` value, never the raw list.

`main.py` needs one new early branch, not a change to `resolve_country_list()` itself (that
function's job — turning a country list into... a country list — doesn't fit "there is no country
list, run one job for the whole year"). In `process_tradeflow`'s caller (the per-year loop around
`main.py:408`), check `country_list.lower() == 'comprehensive'` *before* calling
`resolve_country_list`/`filter_incomplete_countries`/`process_tradeflow`, and dispatch to a new
`run_comprehensive_processing(year)` instead. That function runs a new script
(`trade_comprehensive.py`, see below) once per year via the same `subprocess.run(...,
env={**os.environ, 'EXIOBASE_YEAR': str(year)})` pattern `run_country_processing` already uses —
no `EXIOBASE_COUNTRY`/`EXIOBASE_TRADEFLOW` needed, since comprehensive has neither, but it does
pass through `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS` if set. Once `trade_comprehensive.py` exits,
`run_comprehensive_processing` also runs the new Azure-export step (see "Local `.csv` output for
country folders" below) for whichever region list `COMPREHENSIVE.folders` resolved to (all 49 by
default, or just the `default`-14), so `year/{year}/{country}/{domestic,imports,exports}/
trade.csv` exist locally exactly as if `default`/`all` had been run for that region — `--interstate
US` and the rest of `run_country_processing`'s script chain (`trade_impact.py`/`trade_resource.py`/
`trade_competitiveness.py`) keep working unmodified against those files afterward. That downstream
script chain itself stays scoped to the `default`-14 regardless of `COMPREHENSIVE.folders` — it's
per-country economic/competitiveness analysis, not something this plan extends to the other 35 by
default; a region outside `default` that gets a folder from `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all` gets
`trade.csv`/`trade_factor.csv` and a `runnote.md`, not `trade_impact.csv`/`export_competitiveness.csv`
unless separately requested.

## Confirmed: Exiobase's regions have a fixed, discoverable order

The plan text asked to investigate whether regions "reside in the Exiobase file in an indexed
order" — yes. Read directly from `unit.txt` inside `exiobase_data/IOT_2021_pxp.zip` (first-seen
order of the `region` column, which matches `Z.txt`'s column order):

```
1  AT   8  EE   15 IE   22 PL   29 US   36 MX   43 ID
2  BE   9  ES   16 IT   23 PT   30 JP   37 RU   44 ZA
3  BG   10 FI   17 LT   24 RO   31 CN   38 AU   45 WA
4  CY   11 FR   18 LU   25 SE   32 CA   39 CH   46 WL
5  CZ   12 GR   19 LV   26 SI   33 KR   40 TR   47 WE
6  DE   13 HR   20 MT   27 SK   34 BR   41 TW   48 WF
7  DK   14 HU   21 NL   28 GB   35 IN   42 NO   49 WM
```
(44 country rows + 5 RoW aggregates: WA/WL/WE/WF/WM, last)

(exact list: `AT BE BG CY CZ DE DK EE ES FI FR GR HR HU IE IT LT LU LV MT NL PL PT RO SE SI SK GB
US JP CN CA KR BR IN MX RU AU CH TR TW NO ID ZA WA WL WE WF WM` — 49 total, EU-27 first, then
non-EU OECD-ish countries, then the 5 Rest-of-World aggregates last). This is stable across at
least the 2019–2023 files already downloaded (spot-checked 2021; pymrio's `parse_exiobase3` always
yields this same column order per Exiobase's own file format, not something the loader controls).

**This order is not used to *derive* `trade_id` across regions** (see next section for why a
formula predicting US's block from this list is the wrong tool for that) but it is used to
pre-seed the `region` table (below), and it's useful context for anyone reading a
`region1`/`region2` value that isn't in the curated 14. It's also, since a later revision of this
plan, the basis for `trade_id` order *within* one region's own rows too — see
`extract_region_chunk`'s ordering step in `trade_extraction.py` and README.md's "Exiobase trade
record order" note. That took two attempts to get right: `.stack(future_stack=True)` turned out to
unconditionally re-sort its output alphabetically (no way to opt out), and even after switching to
a numpy-based reshape that preserves file order, a naive "first row to survive the amount
threshold" order turned out to reflect which regions/industries happen to trade early in the
sector list that particular year, not Exiobase's fixed column position (confirmed against real
2021 data: Malta's very first raw sector has zero measured flow to Austria specifically, but not
to Italy, which would make Austria look like it comes "after" Italy under a survival-based order).
The fix computes each row's position from pure structural facts — region's fixed list position,
industry's fixed sector position — entirely decoupled from which cells happen to clear that year's
threshold.

## `region` table: pre-seed the full 49, decouple from `block_index`

`region(country VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY, block_index INTEGER NOT NULL, name VARCHAR(100))` today
gets one row per country *lazily*, the first time that country is loaded
(`get_or_assign_country_block`, `name` left `NULL` — it only knows the code), and `block_index`
feeds directly into `trade_id_base`'s per-country arithmetic. Comprehensive rows don't use
`block_index` for anything (their `trade_id` is a plain running counter — next section), but the
table should still hold the comprehensive list, since it's also the FK target for `trade.country`
and the natural place to document "these are all the regions this database can ever see a value
for." `name` (added via an idempotent `ALTER TABLE region ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, matching the
existing pattern for `trade.flow_type`/`country`) makes it a real region reference table instead of
just a `block_index` lookup — populated from Exiobase's own region names, hardcoded alongside
`COMPREHENSIVE_REGIONS` in `merge_years.rs` (matching `profile/impacts/exiobase/exio-country-names.csv`,
not read from that file at runtime).

**Note: this makes `region`'s row count/coverage useless as a "has this year gone comprehensive"
signal** — every database gets all 49 codes seeded on this same preflight step regardless of
`target`, whether or not full trade data for all 49 ends up loaded, and even a single country's own
exports touch most other regions as `trade.region2` regardless. See "Send Trade Data to Azure" panel
note in "Implementation status" above — that check uses database size instead, for exactly this
reason.

Add a one-time seed (idempotent, `ON CONFLICT (country) DO UPDATE SET name = EXCLUDED.name` so a
country the old per-country path already assigned a `block_index` to keeps it, but gets its `name`
backfilled) that inserts all 49 codes above in their canonical order as `block_index` 1–49, with
their names. A country already present (e.g. `US` from the existing 2019/2021/2023 loads) keeps
whatever `block_index` it already has — this seed only fills in the gaps and the name. Do this
once, in the same preflight step that ensures the target database's schema exists (see "Database
write path" below), not per comprehensive run.

## Trade ID scheme: plain sequential, no blocks — and why that's safe

This argument differs slightly by `COMPREHENSIVE.target`, since the two targets have different
schemas (see "Database write path" below):

- **`target: year_db` (default), `industrydb_{year}`:** `trade`/`trade_factor` have a plain
  `PRIMARY KEY (trade_id)` — no `year` column at all, since the database itself is scoped to one
  year. A fresh per-year database has nothing else in it, so a plain 1-based counter (`trade_id =
  row_index + 1`, first row 1, last row N, zero gaps) trivially can't collide with anything.
- **`target: industrydb`, the shared database:** `trade`/`trade_factor`
  (`ensure_merge_infra` in `team/src/merge_years.rs`) have `PRIMARY KEY (year, trade_id)` —
  **`trade_id` only has to be unique within a year**, not across the whole table. The per-country
  block scheme (`(country_block_index - 1) * 3,000,000 + flow_offset`) exists purely to let
  *multiple separate loads of the same year* (one per country, on different days) avoid colliding.
  Comprehensive has no such problem: it builds 2018's entire trade graph in one run, so a plain
  1-based counter can't collide with itself, and `(year, trade_id) = (2018, *)` can't collide with
  any other year already in the table either.

Either way: no `country_block_index`, no `get_or_assign_country_block` call, no `trade_id_base`
arithmetic anywhere in this path.

This also removes the need for `trade_row_already_known`'s bilateral-flow dedup check. That check
exists because the *old* per-country model processes the same underlying flow twice — once as
country A's `exports` file, again as country B's `imports` file — and has to notice the second one
is a duplicate. Comprehensive never produces that duplicate in the first place (see next section:
each region pair is visited exactly once, as the exporter's turn), so the existing natural-key
`UNIQUE` constraint on `trade` (`region1, region2, industry1, industry2`, plus `year` for the
shared-database target) is a pure safety net here (protects a resumed/retried run from
double-inserting), not a routine dedup path.

## Extraction: one pass per region-as-exporter, not three passes per country

`trade.py`'s `extract_m_matrix_data` has the right *filtering conditions* for this, but the wrong
*mechanism* to loop 49 times — reusing it as literally written would be a serious mistake, not
just a stylistic one (see the measured numbers in "Memory management" below). Its `exports`
branch does:

```python
Z = exio_model.Z.copy()                                                   # full 9,800 x 9,800 matrix
Z_stacked = Z.stack(level=['to_region', 'to_sector'], future_stack=True).reset_index()  # 96,040,000 rows
Z_filtered = Z_stacked[Z_stacked['from_region'] == self.country].copy()
Z_filtered = Z_filtered[Z_filtered['to_region'] != self.country].copy()   # <- excludes domestic
```

It stacks the **entire** matrix into long format first, and only *then* filters down to one
region with a boolean mask. That's fine when it happens once per single-country run. Looping it
49 times for comprehensive would redo that full 96M-row stack 49 times over — see below for why
that's not acceptable.

Comprehensive's per-region chunk keeps the same filtering *conditions* (drop the
`to_region != self.country` exclusion, since domestic should stay in) but restructures the
*mechanism*: slice `Z.loc[region]` — that region's own 200 rows × 9,800 columns — **before**
calling `.stack()`, so only that region's ~2M-row slice is ever materialized, never the full 96M-row
one. Same filtering logic, applied to a 49x-smaller starting frame:

```python
keep = (
    ((Z_filtered.from_region == Z_filtered.to_region) & (Z_filtered.flow > 0.001)) |
    ((Z_filtered.from_region != Z_filtered.to_region) & (Z_filtered.flow > 0.01))
)
```

Looping this over all 49 regions (each as `from_region` exactly once) visits every
`(region1, region2)` ordered pair exactly once — region A's exports-to-B and region B's
exports-to-A are different pairs, both produced, but A→B is never produced twice. Domestic
(A→A) falls out for free as the diagonal case instead of needing its own separate run. There is
no separate `imports` pass at all: "B's imports from A" *is* "A's exports to B," already produced
when A had its turn. `flow_type` on each row can just be `'domestic'` (region1 == region2) or
`'international'` (otherwise) — there's no more imports/exports distinction to preserve, since
that distinction was only ever about *whose file* a row came from, and there's only one file now.
`country` becomes `region1` (the exporter) for the same reason.

**By default (`COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all`, 2018's setting), all 49 regions get pushed to the
target database (`industrydb_{year}` or the shared `industrydb` — see "Database write path" below)
and a local folder too.** The extraction loop above still runs for every region regardless of
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` — that's what keeps `trade_id` numbering identical to a full comprehensive
run even when most regions get excluded (see "Trade ID scheme" above) — but as of the 2024 run,
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` stops the loop from computing `trade_factor` or pushing anything
for the 35 non-default regions, not just from writing their local folder: only the 14 `default`-list
regions' chunks (already sitting in memory the moment that region has its turn, so the local file
costs nothing extra in compute — see "Local `.csv` output for country folders" below) get pushed
and written at all. `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS`/`COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all` is still available
for a future year that wants full 49-region Azure coverage again.

## Memory management: stream by region, don't materialize the global matrix

Measured directly against the already-downloaded `IOT_2021_pxp.zip` (49 regions × 200 sectors
confirmed by counting `unit.txt`, so 9,800 × 9,800 = 96,040,000 possible `(from, to)` combinations)
to ground this in real numbers rather than estimates:

| | Full-matrix stack (`Z.stack()` on the whole matrix, then filter — what `extract_m_matrix_data` does today) | Per-region slice, stacked (`Z.loc[region]` **before** `.stack()`) |
|---|---|---|
| Rows produced | 96,040,000 | 1,960,000 |
| Deep memory (object dtype, as `.stack()` naturally produces) | ~29.8 GB | ~492 MB |
| After casting to `category` dtype | — | ~25.5 MB |
| Wall time | 5.7s | 0.3s |
| Process peak RSS | ~10.1 GB (up from a ~4.3 GB baseline — parsing the model itself, with every satellite extension, already costs that much) | ~4.4 GB (barely above the same baseline) |

Today's single-country code pays the left column's cost *once per run* and evidently survives it
(every country/flow-type/year combination loaded so far has finished successfully). Comprehensive
cannot pay that cost 49 times — looping `extract_m_matrix_data` as literally written would replay
a ~10GB-RSS, ~30GB-logical-size operation on every single region, reprocessing 4.7 billion
row-instances in total instead of 96 million. The right column is the actual design for this plan:

1. **Chunk by `from_region`, sliced *before* stacking.** `Z.loc[region]` — that region's own
   200 rows × 9,800 columns — stacked on its own, not filtered out of an already-stacked whole
   matrix. This is the one non-negotiable change from `extract_m_matrix_data`'s current mechanism;
   everything else in this section is a smaller refinement on top of it.
2. **Filter before mapping/grouping**, same order `trade.py` already uses — apply the amount
   threshold on the raw stacked chunk first, *then* map sector names to `industry_id` and
   `groupby`. Shrinks each chunk further before the more expensive steps.
3. **Categorical dtype** for `from_sector`/`to_region`/`to_sector` immediately after `.stack()`
   — per the table above, this is a ~19x reduction on top of the slicing (492MB → 25.5MB per
   chunk) for a single `astype('category')` call per column.
4. **Running `trade_id` counter carried across chunks**, not reset per region: chunk *n*'s first
   `trade_id` is `1 + (sum of rows written by chunks 1..n-1)`.
5. **`trade_factor` computation also happens per chunk**, immediately after that chunk's `trade`
   rows are finalized, using the *existing* `create_trade_factor`/`_aggregate_factors` logic in
   `trade.py` (already internally chunked at 10,000 rows for the `M`-matrix merge — reused
   unmodified, and operating on the chunk's already-aggregated, already-small `trade_df`, not the
   raw stacked frame) — then both are pushed to Postgres and the chunk is freed before the next
   region starts. Peak memory stays at roughly the ~4.3GB parse-time baseline throughout the whole
   49-region loop, not 49 sequential ~10GB spikes.

Recommend pulling `create_trade_factor`, `_aggregate_factors`, and the sector-mapping/threshold
helpers out of `trade.py`'s `ExiobaseTradeFlow` class into a small shared module (e.g.
`trade_extraction.py`) that both `trade.py` (per-country) and the new `trade_comprehensive.py`
import, rather than duplicating ~250 lines. `trade.py` keeps its existing single-country behavior
unchanged; `trade_comprehensive.py` calls the same functions once per region in a loop.

## Database write path: direct Postgres from Python, one of two targets

**Default target: a dedicated per-year database, `industrydb_{year}`** — the same convention
already used for `industrydb_2019`/`industrydb_2021`/`industrydb_2023`, created via
`connect_to_exiobase_year`/`ensure_year_database_exists`/`init_industry_tables_in_pool`
(`team/src/main.rs`), not `connect_to_industrydb`/`ensure_merge_infra`. This needed a real design
change from the plan's original assumption (below): a from-scratch per-year database has no
existing rows for any other year to collide with, so `trade`/`trade_factor` don't need a `year`
column at all there — `trade_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` alone, `country` defaulting to the exporter.
Creating a new database needs `EXIOBASE_PROVISION_*` credentials (separate from the regular
`EXIOBASE_USER`, which lacks `CREATEDB`) — set in `docker/.env` alongside the regular `EXIOBASE_*`
vars.

**Alternative target: the shared, multi-year `industrydb`** (`COMPREHENSIVE.target: industrydb` /
`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET=industrydb`) — the plan's original design, and still useful when
comprehensive data should live alongside the curated-country path's existing merged data.
`connect_to_industrydb()` / `ensure_merge_infra()` (`team/src/merge_years.rs`) point at the
`EXIOBASE_NAME` database on the `EXIOBASE_HOST` server, using `EXIOBASE_USER`/`EXIOBASE_PASSWORD`/
`EXIOBASE_PORT`/`EXIOBASE_SSL_MODE` — no `EXIOBASE_PROVISION_*` needed, since this database already
exists. Its `trade`/`trade_factor` tables already have the `year` column and `(year, trade_id)`
primary key this target needs — no schema changes required here.

Two options for how Python actually writes rows (unchanged by which target is picked — only the
connection's `dbname` and whether `year`/`ON CONFLICT` include a `year` column differ):

- **(A) Python connects directly via `psycopg2`, no Rust involved for the bulk data.** Reuses the
  exact `EXIOBASE_*` env vars (`industrydb.py`'s `get_connection(year, target)` picks `dbname` —
  either `{EXIOBASE_NAME}_{year}` or plain `EXIOBASE_NAME`), `COPY`s each region-chunk's rows into a
  temp staging table, then `INSERT ... SELECT ... ON CONFLICT (region1, region2, industry1,
  industry2)` (`year_db`) or `ON CONFLICT (year, region1, region2, industry1, industry2)`
  (`industrydb`) into `trade` — either way mirrors the natural-key constraint, making a
  retried/resumed run idempotent. Fastest option by far for millions of rows — no per-row HTTP/JSON
  overhead, no re-parsing CSV text server-side. This repo already has a (currently unused) precedent
  for Python→Postgres via `SQLAlchemy`/`psycopg2` in `insert_sql.py`, though that script's plain
  `to_sql(method="multi")` is line-at-a-time compared to `COPY` and has no dedup — worth referencing
  for the connection-string pattern, not for the insert method.
- **(B) A new Rust endpoint accepts a raw CSV/NDJSON body** (not a GitHub URL) and reuses
  `insert_trade_rows`-style chunked-insert code. Keeps all DB-writing logic in one language, but
  adds an HTTP hop + full serialize/deserialize round-trip for every row, which is the exact cost
  this plan is trying to avoid for large-scale data.

**Recommend (A) for `trade`/`trade_factor`** (the only tables large enough for the round-trip cost
to matter), but keep the *small* reference tables — `factor`, `industry`, `sector`,
`sector_industry` — going through Rust, via `POST /api/db/comprehensive/push-reference-tables`
(`team/src/merge_years.rs`), which accepts `year`, an optional `target`, and the same four small
CSVs `main.py` already produces locally (`factor.csv`, `industry.csv`, `sector.csv`,
`sector_industry.csv` — a few hundred KB total). This endpoint is also the preflight step
`trade_comprehensive.py` calls once before it starts streaming region chunks — it ensures the
target database/schema exists and seeds `region` with all 49 codes (+ names — see "`region` table"
above) — and it branches its reference-table upserts by target:

- `target: year_db` (default): `init_industry_tables_in_pool`, then the plain `upsert_factor_rows`/
  `upsert_industry_rows`/`upsert_sector_rows`/`upsert_sector_industry_rows` — a from-scratch
  database has no existing `factor` rows to match against, so no remap, and no `factor_id_map` in
  the response.
- `target: industrydb`: `ensure_merge_infra`, then `upsert_factor_rows_merged` (which matches
  incoming rows against `industrydb`'s existing rows by `(extension, stressor)` and remaps
  `factor_id` accordingly — see `PLAN-merge.md`'s "factor table" section — reimplementing that
  matching logic in Python would be new, delicate code duplicating something that already works)
  plus the same plain `upsert_industry_rows`/`upsert_sector_rows`/`upsert_sector_industry_rows`.
  `factor_id_map` (the old→new remap) comes back in the response for this target only.

## Local `.csv` output for country folders — memory for exports/domestic, Azure for imports

Three related questions this section answers: (1) can comprehensive produce local `.csv` folders
at all, so a webpage reading `year/{year}/{country}/{flow}/trade.csv` sees `trade_id` values that
line up with `industrydb`, (2) for how many of the 49 regions (all of them, by default — see
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` above), and (3) can a `[year]/[country]` folder be added *later*, for a
region that wasn't given a folder the first time (e.g. `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` was used,
or the region is genuinely new), with the same alignment?

**Chosen design (revised for the 2024 run — see below for why the original Azure-pull design was
replaced): everything comes from this run's own in-memory extraction, nothing is read back from
Azure.** A region's own chunk (built when it has its turn as `from_region`) contains that region's
**domestic** rows (`region1 == region2`) and **exports** rows (`region1 == region, region2 !=
region1`) in full — nothing else in the 49-region loop can add to either, so they're final the
moment that region's chunk is computed. That same chunk also contains every *other* in-scope
country's **imports** from this region (its rows where `region2` is one of `folder_regions` and
`region2 != region`) — so instead of waiting for the full loop to finish and pulling them back from
`industrydb`, `capture_imports_for_others()` (`trade_comprehensive.py`) slices them out right there,
appending to a per-country accumulator that gets written out once the loop ends.

- **Exports + domestic, for every in-scope region, sliced straight out of that region's own
  in-memory chunk** at the point in the loop where that region has its turn — no database
  round-trip. Same for their `trade_factor` rows, already computed per-chunk anyway (see "Memory
  management" above) using the `factor_id` mapping already finalized by the reference-table
  preflight step, so no remap risk here either. Written via the same `get_file_path(config, ...)`
  calls `trade.py` already uses, with `EXIOBASE_COUNTRY=<region>` in the environment — same file,
  same format, same `trade_id` values that were just pushed to `industrydb` for that chunk. Skipped
  entirely for a region `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` excludes — see "Trade ID scheme" above for
  what still happens to that region's `trade_id` range.
- **Imports, for every in-scope region, assembled from every one of the 49 regions' chunks as the
  loop visits them** — `capture_imports_for_others()` filters each region's chunk (whether or not
  that region itself is in scope) for rows destined for an in-scope country, computes
  `trade_factor` for just that filtered subset (or reuses the whole-chunk result already computed,
  for an in-scope exporter that needed it anyway for its own push), and appends to that country's
  accumulator. Once the 49-region loop finishes, each in-scope country's accumulated rows are
  concatenated and written out — no network round-trip at all, and correct regardless of
  `COMPREHENSIVE.folders`: an out-of-scope exporter's flows to an in-scope importer are still
  captured even though that exporter's own domestic/exports never reach Azure or disk anywhere
  else.

**Why this replaced the original pull-from-`industrydb` design.** The original version left
exports/domestic as an in-memory slice but pulled imports back from `industrydb` after the full
loop finished (`SELECT ... FROM trade WHERE region2 = :country`), reasoning that a country's
imports may be contributed by any of the other 48 regions, so they can only be complete once every
region has had its turn. That's still true, but the original design assumed `industrydb` would
always hold all 49 regions' rows to pull from — true only when `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all`
(2018's setting). Once `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` also started limiting the Azure push itself
(the 2024 change — see "Trade ID scheme" above), a pull-based imports step would only ever see the
default-14's own inter-trade, silently missing every flow from the 35 regions that were never
pushed. In-memory capture during the same single pass fixes this for both settings at once, and is
strictly cheaper than the round-trip it replaces, so it's now the only mechanism — there's no
Azure-pull code path left to choose between.

`trade_id` alignment is exact — every captured imports row keeps the same `trade_id` it was
assigned as part of its *exporting* region's own chunk (see "Trade ID scheme" above), so an
importer's `imports.csv` ends up with ids scattered across the full 49-region range, grouped by
whichever region happened to export each row, not sequential or grouped by the importer itself —
exactly Exiobase's own row order, just reassembled by destination instead of by source. `bea/
main.py`, `india/main.py`, `trade_impact.py`, `trade_resource.py`, and `trade_competitiveness.py`
all keep reading local files in the same shape they always have, unmodified. Column layout matches
what `trade.py`/`create_trade_factor` already write (`trade_id, region1, region2, industry1,
industry2, amount` and `trade_id, factor_id, level` — confirmed against `trade.py:export_to_csv`
and the Rust CSV parsers in `insert_trade_rows`/`insert_trade_factor_rows`, which read those exact
headers).

Only the `default`-14 get the full `trade_impact.py`/`trade_resource.py`/`trade_competitiveness.py`
subprocess chain afterward, exactly as `run_country_processing` does today (see previous section) —
for those 14, `create_runnote`'s existing `success_count`/`total_scripts` bookkeeping only needs to
account for those three scripts, not four, since `trade.py` itself was skipped (its output already
exists). The other 35 (when `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all`) get a `runnote.md` documenting just the
in-memory `trade.csv`/`trade_factor.csv` derivation — no scripts ran for them, so that line is
simply omitted rather than reported as `0/3`.

One correctness detail that's easy to miss: **local `factor.csv` must also be exported from
`industrydb`'s `factor` table, not generated locally by `factors.py`'s `create_factors_csv()`.**
That function assigns `factor_id` by walking Exiobase's own extension/stressor order fresh every
run, starting at 1 — fine in isolation, but `industrydb`'s `factor` table only agrees with that
numbering for the *first* year ever merged into it. Every later year's `upsert_factor_rows_merged`
remaps incoming `factor_id`s to match existing rows by `(extension, stressor)` (see
`PLAN-merge.md`'s "factor table" section), so by the time 2018 runs, `industrydb.factor` already
holds 728 rows from 2019/2021/2023 with IDs that don't line up with a fresh local 1-based count.
Exporting `factor.csv` from `industrydb.factor` (`factor_id, unit, stressor, extension` — same
four columns `create_factors_csv()` writes, different source) keeps `trade_factor.csv`'s
`factor_id` values meaningful against the `factor.csv` shipped alongside it.

**Answering "add a `[year]/[country]` folder later":** once a year has gone through comprehensive,
every region's rows are already in whichever database that run targeted, regardless of
`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` — that setting only ever controlled which regions got a *local file*, never
which regions got pushed to Azure (that's always all 49). So "add a folder later" now almost always
means "a region `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` excluded the first time," not "a region
comprehensive never saw" — there's no such thing as the latter for a year that's already been
through comprehensive. Either way the answer is the same: **always export from Azure, never re-run
the Exiobase extraction, for any year already loaded.** Unlike the in-loop case above, there's no
in-memory chunk left to slice from by then — the comprehensive run that built it is long finished —
so a later request (`export_country_csvs.py`) pulls **all three** flow types
(`exports`/`domestic`/`imports`, not just `imports`) from that same target database, with the same
`SELECT` shape, using `region1 = :country AND region2 != :country` for exports and
`region1 = region2 = :country` for domestic instead of the in-memory filter — `COMPREHENSIVE.target`
(or `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET`) needs to match whichever target that year was originally loaded
with, since the two targets are different databases (`industrydb_{year}` vs. the shared
`industrydb`). Re-deriving from the raw Exiobase `.zip` (Exiobase's indexed region order,
re-parsing, re-stacking) is strictly worse for this case — slower (re-downloads/re-parses a
multi-GB file and re-runs the six-extension factor merge from scratch), and, if a future code
change ever alters a threshold or aggregation rule, silently *riskier*: a locally-recomputed file
could drift from what's actually stored without either side erroring, whereas a straight export
can't drift because it has no independent computation to drift from. Re-running the Exiobase
extraction only remains relevant for a year that hasn't been comprehensively loaded at all yet — an
entirely different situation ("load a new year," covered by "Rollout" below) from "get an existing
year's data into one more local folder."

## `.gitignore` — worth deciding on before the first `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: all` run

With all 49 regions writing local folders by default, `trade-data` gains real new volume every
comprehensive year — not the "many GB" the full in-memory matrix would have been (that risk is
fully handled by the per-region streaming design regardless of folder count), just the ordinary
linear cost of ~3.5x today's 14-country footprint per year. Whether to commit all 49 regions'
folders or only the `default`-14's is a `trade-data` git-history/repo-size decision for whoever
maintains it, independent of this plan — `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` avoids generating the
other 35 at all; `.gitignore`-ing a pattern like `year/*/[A-Z][A-Z]/` for the non-`default` codes
is the alternative if the files should exist locally but never be committed. Separately, if a
future debugging pass wants an optional local dump of a comprehensive run for inspection, write it
under `trade-data/year/{year}/comprehensive/` and add that path to `trade-data/.gitignore`
(parallel to the existing `year/**/*-lg.*` entry) before it's ever produced — never commit a
comprehensive-scale file.

## Rollout: 2018

1. Download `IOT_2018_pxp.zip` (`ensure_exiobase_file`, reused as-is — not present in
   `exiobase_data/` yet, unlike 2019/2020/2021/2022/2023).
2. Preflight: call the reference-tables endpoint (creates `industrydb_2018` if it doesn't exist —
   needs `EXIOBASE_PROVISION_*` credentials — creates/updates `factor`/`industry`/`sector`/
   `sector_industry`, seeds `region` with all 49 codes + names). Pass `target: "industrydb"` instead
   to use the shared database (`ensure_merge_infra`) rather than a new `industrydb_2018`.
3. Run `trade_comprehensive.py` for 2018 (`COMPREHENSIVE.folders` left at its default, `all`) — it
   prints a confirmation banner naming the resolved target database and waits for `y` before
   proceeding (or set `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_CONFIRM=yes` to skip it non-interactively). Loops all
   49 regions, streams `trade`/`trade_factor` chunks straight into `industrydb_2018` (default) or
   the shared `industrydb` (`year=2018`), and, for every one of the 49, slices that region's own
   chunk into `year/2018/{country}/{domestic,exports}/trade.csv`+`trade_factor.csv` as it goes (no
   Azure round-trip for these). Consider `COMPREHENSIVE.folders: default` for a first dry run
   against a scratch `trade-data` checkout, to see the Azure-only 35 vs. local-49 split before
   committing to the full footprint.
4. Once all 49 regions are done, pull `imports` for all 49 from the same target database
   (`year/2018/{country}/imports/trade.csv`+`trade_factor.csv`), timing each region's pull for its
   `runnote.md` line. Export the shared `year/2018/factor.csv` from that database's `factor` table
   (using the `factor_map` the preflight step returned, if `target: industrydb`) and copy the
   locally-produced `industry.csv`/`sector.csv`/`sector_industry.csv` into place (never remapped, no
   Azure round trip needed for those).
5. Verify: `SELECT count(*) FROM trade` (default target — no `year` filter needed, the database is
   already scoped to 2018) or `SELECT count(*) FROM trade WHERE year=2018` (`industrydb` target) has
   no gaps in `trade_id` (`max(trade_id) = count(*)`), `region` has all 49 codes,
   `fk_trade_region`/`fk_trade_industry1`/`fk_trade_industry2` have zero violations, and every
   region folder's three `trade_id` ranges (exports/domestic from memory, imports from Azure) are
   disjoint and all present in the target database.
6. Run `bea/main.py` (`--interstate US`) against the 2018 `US/domestic` folder exactly as done for
   2019/2021/2023 today, confirm `interstate` rows insert with no FK violations against `trade`
   (`industrydb_2018` default target, or `trade(2018, *)` for the shared-database target).

| `create_runnote()` (extended with a second timing line, not replaced — see previous section) | `export_country_csvs.py` — pulls **all three** flow types, target-aware, for any later ad-hoc `[year]/[country]` folder request where no in-memory chunk exists any more |
| `config_loader.load_config`'s existing env-override pattern (`EXIOBASE_TRADEFLOW` etc.) | `COMPREHENSIVE.folders`/`COMPREHENSIVE.target` config.yaml keys + `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_FOLDERS`/`EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_TARGET` overrides — folders: `all` (default, all 49 get folders) vs. `default` (just the 14); target: `year_db` (default, dedicated `industrydb_{year}`) vs. `industrydb` (shared database) |
| `trade_row_already_known` — **not reused**, not needed (see "Trade ID scheme") | `trade_comprehensive.py`'s terminal confirmation prompt (`confirm_comprehensive_push`) — names the resolved target database, requires `y`; `EXIOBASE_COMPREHENSIVE_CONFIRM=yes` bypasses it non-interactively |
| `country_block_index`/`trade_id_base`/`get_or_assign_country_block` — **not reused** for comprehensive's own `trade_id` assignment, but `get_or_assign_country_block` still runs for the old per-country path against the same `region` table comprehensive now also seeds | |
| `fetch_github_csv` / committing `trade.csv` to `trade-data` — **not used** for comprehensive rows | |
| `factors.py`'s `create_factors_csv()` local numbering — **not reused** for exported `factor.csv` (must come from the target database's own `factor` table, see previous section) | |
| — | `team/admin/sql/panel`'s "Send Trade Data to Azure" UI — size-based comprehensive detection (`GET /api/db/database-size`), hides its per-country checkboxes/buttons once a year's `industrydb_{year}` looks comprehensive |
